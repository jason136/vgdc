# Getting Started
Although our club embraces any and all ways to create a video game, we will focus primarily on the Unity game engine. 
Below are some of our recommendations for free asset creation. 
## Scripting
* For scripting with C# and Unity, we strongly recommend Microsoft Visual Studio.

## 3D Assets
* Blender offers a myriad of tools for all aspects of 3D asset creation. From basic meshes to advanced shaders, we highly recommend Blender.

## 2D Assets
* Adobe Photoshop is a great piece of software for 2D art creation. It is not free, but it is the single most pirated piece of software on the internet (we do not condone piracy).

* Krita is a fan favorite for 2D drawing and asset creation, and it's free!

* Aseprite is a personal favorite for making pixel art assets. You can buy it, but it is open-source which means it's free if you're willing to compile it from its source code (YouTube is your friend for this process).

## Sound
* Adobe Audition is a very useful for sound design, but is not free.

* Audacity is a wonderful alternative to the above.

# Contributing
This mono-repository is only as powerful as its contributors make it, so please do not hesitate to make a pull request if you have something productive to add!

Not sure how? Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) to learn how to fork, clone, push, and pull your changes into the official mono-repository. 

When making a pull request, please detail all changes in the request message. Requests will be merged if they are deemed to be productive to the repository, though to be honest we'd love some contributors so that won't a very high bar to clear.
